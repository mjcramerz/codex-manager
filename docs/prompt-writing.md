## Use this file when
- you need general prompt-writing advice that is not specific to runtime prompt assets
- you want to improve instruction quality, precision, or validation wording

## Include (high-signal)
- exact behavior to implement
- acceptance criteria (observable, verifiable)
- constraints (no network, target OS, perf budget)
- examples (inputs/outputs) when behavior is subtle
- tests to add or run
- threat model notes when handling untrusted input

## Avoid
- long preambles
- restating generic best practices
- ambiguous scope (“make it better” without a target)

## Tips
- Reference files or modules to anchor the agent.
- Use absolute paths for critical files and commands.
- Prefer one clear objective over multi-part requests in a single prompt.
- Call out non-negotiables first (security, data safety, rollout constraints).

## Review checklist
- Is the request concrete and bounded?
- Are acceptance criteria observable?
- Are the critical constraints explicit?
- Does the prompt tell the agent what to verify?

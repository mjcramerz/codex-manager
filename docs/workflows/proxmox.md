# Proxmox workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-proxmox.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: provision and maintain Proxmox VMs safely.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: node, storage backend, network bridge, VM template.
2) **Plan**: resource sizing, backups, and snapshot strategy.
3) **Create**: clone template or create VM with cloud-init.
4) **Verify**: console access, networking, and storage mounts.

## Safety rules
- Avoid storage changes without backups.
- Keep templates immutable; clone per VM.

## Security checkpoints
- Use scoped Proxmox roles/API tokens and avoid broad root automation credentials.
- Validate bridge/storage placement against tenant or trust-zone boundaries.
- Ensure backup targets and snapshots follow encryption/access policy.

## Testing checkpoints
- Boot-test template clones with cloud-init and guest-agent checks.
- Run backup and snapshot restore drills on representative VMs.
- Validate migration/start-stop behavior on target node classes.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Promote template or VM config changes from staging pool to production nodes.
- Schedule storage/network-impacting changes in maintenance windows.
- Record VMID allocation, rollback snapshot IDs, and recovery owner.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides node, storage, bridge targets, and HA constraints.
- Executor hands off VM config diffs, task logs, and restore-test evidence.
- Receiver tracks capacity impact and post-change alerting outcomes.

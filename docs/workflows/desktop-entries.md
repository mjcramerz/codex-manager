# Desktop entries workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-desktop-entries.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: create safe, consistent `.desktop` launchers.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: app name, icon, categories, exec path.
2) **Draft**: create a `.desktop` file with absolute paths.
3) **Install**: copy to `~/.local/share/applications/` or `/usr/share/applications/`.
4) **Validate**: run `desktop-file-validate` when available.

## Safety rules
- Avoid `Exec=sh -c` unless unavoidable.
- Never embed secrets in `Exec=` arguments.

## Security checkpoints
- Require trusted absolute paths for `Exec=`, `Icon=`, and optional `Path=` fields.
- Avoid shell interpolation and untrusted argument expansion in launcher commands.
- Keep system-wide `.desktop` files root-owned with controlled write access.

## Testing checkpoints
- Run `desktop-file-validate` and confirm launcher parsing is clean.
- Smoke-launch as a non-privileged user and verify expected process arguments.
- Check menu/category visibility and MIME bindings in target desktop environments.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Deploy to user-local location first, then promote to system scope if needed.
- Keep versioned launcher templates and prior file copies for rollback.
- Refresh desktop cache/indexes when required and log the commands used.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides app path, icon source, categories, and MIME expectations.
- Executor hands off `.desktop` diff, validation output, and launch-test evidence.
- Receiver confirms packaging/install scripts place the launcher in the intended path.

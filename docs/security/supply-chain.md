## Principles
- **Minimize dependencies**. Every dep is attack surface.
- **Pin and lock**. Commit lockfiles, freeze versions, and review changes.
- **Verify provenance**. Prefer signed releases, checksums, and trusted registries.
- **Automate auditing**. Make vulnerability scans part of CI.

## Language ecosystems
### Node.js
- Commit `package-lock.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` / `yarn.lock`.
- Prefer `npm ci` in CI.
- Consider `npm config set ignore-scripts true` for CI if feasible.
- Use `npm audit`/`pnpm audit` + GitHub dependency review.

### Python
- Pin dependencies (hashes if possible).
- Use `pip-audit` or OSV scan.
- Prefer `pip install --require-hashes` for high-assurance builds.

### Rust
- Commit `Cargo.lock` (even for binaries).
- Use `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` (licenses, bans, advisories).
- Consider vendoring deps for hermetic builds when required by policy.

## Containers & CI
- Pin base images by tag (or digest for high assurance).
- Pin CI actions by version; use SHA pinning when required.
- Avoid running untrusted build scripts without review.

## Codex source controls to mirror
- Keep release preflight and artifact build controls aligned with `.github/workflows/build-codex-rs.yml`.
- Keep publish orchestration aligned with `.github/workflows/release-codex-rs.yml` and pinned reusable workflow SHAs.
- Keep release event handling aligned with `.github/workflows/publish-codex-rs.yml`.
- Validate config schema packaging, checksum generation, and release-tip tag checks as part of release hardening.

## Avoid
- `curl | sh`
- ad-hoc download+execute binaries without checksums
- unpinned “latest” Docker images for builds
- unpinned GitHub Actions and third-party CI plugins in high-assurance environments
- running package install scripts in CI without review (Node `postinstall`, etc.)

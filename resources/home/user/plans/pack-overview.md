# Plan
Purpose: coordinate multi-surface runtime-pack changes while keeping docs, config, and instruction assets synchronized for the Codex coding agent.
You must read only the smallest section that resolves the current task, follow the first matching route, and stop broad browsing once the next concrete file or command is clear.

Use this plan for multi-surface changes to the Codex pack.

## Navigation
<!-- BEGIN:nav -->
- Parent: `$CODEX_HOME/plans/OVERVIEW.md`
- Pack index: `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- Routing guide: `$CODEX_HOME/index/OVERVIEW.md`
<!-- END:nav -->

## Requirements
- Clear statement of scope and affected pack surfaces.
- Updated routing and discovery links.
- Instruction assets, memory routing, and config fragments stay synchronized when one of those contracts changes.

## Scope
- In: coordinated updates within `$CODEX_HOME/`.
- Out: product feature changes outside the pack.

## Files and entry points
- `$CODEX_HOME/index/manifest.yml`
- `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/docs/OVERVIEW.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/index/pack/skills.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/memories/`

## Action items
[ ] Review entrypoints and overviews for the affected surfaces.
[ ] Update `$CODEX_HOME/index/manifest.yml` metadata and related links.
[ ] Update paired instruction/config/doc surfaces together when the change crosses runtime-pack boundaries.

## Security checkpoints
- You must confirm trust boundaries, credentials, and least-privilege assumptions before execution.
- You must validate input bounds, timeout/retry limits, and failure behavior for risky operations.
- You must record any approved exception, owner, and expiry before proceeding.

## Testing checkpoints
- You must define fast-path and deep validation commands before making changes.
- You must capture expected outcomes and acceptance criteria for each validation step.
- You must re-run impacted checks after major changes and before final handoff.

## Deployment checkpoints
- You must document rollout order, blast-radius controls, and rollback conditions.
- You must confirm migration/backfill or feature-flag sequencing when applicable.
- You must record post-deploy verification owners and evidence.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator hands off scope, constraints, and stop condition with the target entrypoint.
- Executor reports touched files, commands run, evidence, blockers, and next action.
- Receiving agent acknowledges handoff completeness before continuing execution.

## Risks and edge cases
- Broken related links or stale entrypoints.
- Missing metadata on new files.

## Examples
- Example objective: "Coordinate a multi-surface runtime-pack update across docs, plans, and routing."
- Example validation: "make preflight && make verify"

## Open questions
- None.

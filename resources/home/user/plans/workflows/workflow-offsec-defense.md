## Inputs
- `$CODEX_HOME/docs/workflows/offsec-defense.md`
- Scope file and change window details

## Scope
- In: scoped offensive simulation and cyber-defense validation workflow.
- Out: out-of-scope offensive activity or target interaction outside the documented scope.

- For API/protocol surfaces, define contract versioning, timeout/retry ceilings, and idempotency/error-model expectations.

## Action items
[ ] Read `$CODEX_HOME/docs/workflows/offsec-defense.md` and related references.
[ ] Validate documented scope (`scope_id`, targets, allowed operation classes).
[ ] Execute bounded simulation and defense validation tracks inside the documented scope.
[ ] Record evidence, findings, owners, and re-test criteria.
[ ] Re-run targeted validation after remediation updates.

## Testing and validation
- Run validation steps specified by the workflow and linked references.

## Security checkpoints
- Confirm trust boundaries, credentials, and least-privilege assumptions before execution.
- Validate input bounds, timeout/retry limits, and failure behavior for risky operations.
- Record any documented exception, owner, and expiry before proceeding.

## Testing checkpoints
- Define fast-path and deep validation commands before making changes.
- Capture expected outcomes and acceptance criteria for each validation step.
- Re-run impacted checks after major changes and before final handoff.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Document rollout order, blast-radius controls, and rollback conditions.
- Confirm migration/backfill or feature-flag sequencing when applicable.
- Record post-deploy verification owners and evidence.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator hands off scope, constraints, and stop condition with the target entrypoint.
- Executor reports touched files, commands run, evidence, blockers, and next action.
- Receiving agent acknowledges handoff completeness before continuing execution.

## Risks and edge cases
- Scope drift between documented targets and executed targets.
- Defensive telemetry gaps that hide meaningful simulation outcomes.

## Examples

- Example objective: "<short task statement>"
- Example validation: "<command or check>"

## Open questions
- None.

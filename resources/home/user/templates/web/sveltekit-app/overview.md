# SvelteKit app scaffold (overview)
Wrapper around the official SvelteKit scaffold.

## Recommended approach
1) Pick a pinned SvelteKit version approved by your org.
2) Run `npm create svelte@<version>`.
3) Add CI workflows from `$CODEX_HOME/templates/ci/github-actions/` or `$CODEX_HOME/templates/ci/gitlab-ci/`.

## Notes
- Pin Node.js and SvelteKit versions.
- Document adapter choices and deployment targets.

## Inputs
- Destination repository path for this template.
- Exact runtime/toolchain versions and pinning policy.
- Repository-specific values for placeholders, secrets, and host paths.

## Outputs
- Files copied from this template directory.
- No additional files are currently defined in this template directory.

## Next steps
1) Copy files into deterministic repository paths.
2) Replace placeholders and pin versions/images before first commit.
3) Run the narrowest relevant checks (lint/test/build or dry-run) before commit.

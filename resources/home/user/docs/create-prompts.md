# Create prompts
Purpose: define how runtime prompt files under `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/` should be written, reviewed, and maintained.

## Navigation
<!-- BEGIN:nav -->
- Parent: `$CODEX_HOME/docs/OVERVIEW.md`
- Pack index: `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- Routing guide: `$CODEX_HOME/index/OVERVIEW.md`
<!-- END:nav -->

## Scope
- This is the only documentation file under `$CODEX_HOME/*` that should directly reference prompt files in `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/`.
- Use it when creating, revising, or reviewing reusable prompt assets intended for Codex requests.

## Current prompt files
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/codex-general.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/bugfix.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/feature-implementation.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/code-review.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/docs-refresh.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/shell-runtime.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/.prompt/windows-manager.md`

## File contract
- Every prompt file must be Markdown.
- The first line must be a short HTML comment that describes the prompt in one sentence.
- The body should be ready to paste into a Codex request with minimal editing.
- Keep the wording concrete, directive, and operational rather than conversational.

## Design rules
- Start with the role and domain depth that the task actually needs.
- State the task objective early.
- Require read-first behavior before edits.
- Call out critical constraints explicitly: correctness, security, compatibility, rollout, or testing.
- Prefer deterministic instructions over vague requests such as “improve this” or “make it better”.
- Keep prompts concise enough to scan quickly, but detailed enough to drive the full task without extra interpretation.

## Maintenance notes
- Keep prompt file names lower-case and hyphenated.
- When adding a new prompt file, update this document and nowhere else in `$CODEX_HOME/*`.
- Do not reference runtime-only state or local credentials from prompt assets.

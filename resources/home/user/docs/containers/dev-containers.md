# Dev containers
Purpose: guide reproducible development containers for local work, CI parity, and Codex-oriented tool bundles.

## Navigation
<!-- BEGIN:nav -->
- Parent: `$CODEX_HOME/docs/containers/overview.md`
- Pack index: `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- Routing guide: `$CODEX_HOME/index/OVERVIEW.md`
<!-- END:nav -->

## Use this file when
- you need a portable developer environment across machines
- you want Docker and Podman support from one scaffold
- you need to choose between non-root default, root override, or offline runtime

## Current template contract
Use `$CODEX_HOME/templates/containers/devlab-codelab-skeleton/` as the primary scaffold.
It already carries:
- `compose.yml`
- `compose.offline.override.yml`
- `compose.rootful.override.yml`
- `compose.podman.override.yml`
- `.env.example`
- `rootless_env.sh`

## Decision points
- Engine: Docker rootless, Docker rootful, Podman rootless, or Podman rootful
- Container user: non-root by default; root only for clearly justified package/bootstrap steps
- Network mode: online build/runtime vs explicit offline runtime
- Host ownership: UID/GID mapping or `userns_mode: keep-id`

## Validation
- Render the chosen compose files before first run.
- Confirm container user, UID/GID, bind-mount ownership, and published ports.
- Re-run the template's local verification commands after changing the package/tool list.

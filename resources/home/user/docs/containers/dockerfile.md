# Dockerfile guidance
How to write Dockerfiles that are rootless-friendly, reproducible, and secure by default.

## Baseline rules
- Run the service process as a non-root user (`USER` in Dockerfile).
- Avoid `:latest` base images; pin versions (use digests for high assurance).
- Keep layers minimal; clean package caches.
- Use `.dockerignore` to keep secrets and build artifacts out of the context.
- Prefer `COPY --chown` so app files are owned by the non-root UID/GID at build time.

## Rootless considerations
- Rootless Docker/Podman use the same Dockerfile; the differences are daemon-level.
- Prefer high ports (`>=1024`) and map them in compose/run.
- Avoid host network mode (`network_mode: host`) for rootless workflows.
- If volume permissions are an issue, set ownership at build time with numeric UID/GID.

## UID/GID and bind mounts
- When bind-mounting host paths, match the container runtime user to the engine UID/GID.
- Pass the same UID/GID as build args so image ownership matches the runtime user (see templates).
- Prefer numeric IDs in `USER` and `chown` to avoid name mismatches.

## Podman notes
- Prefer `Dockerfile` so Docker + Podman share the same build definition.
- Use `Containerfile` only if the repo already standardizes on it.
- Rootful Podman uses the same file; the engine mode changes, not the Dockerfile.

## Template (recommended start)
- Template: `$CODEX_HOME/templates/containers/dockerfile-skeleton/`
- Snippets: `$CODEX_HOME/snippets/containers/`

## Build/run example
```bash
docker context use rootless   # or: docker context use rootful

docker build -t app:dev .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 app:dev
```

## Security checklist
- Non-root runtime user (numeric UID/GID OK).
- No secrets in build context or image layers.
- Explicit entrypoint and port exposure.
- Pair with compose defaults: `read_only`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `no-new-privileges`.

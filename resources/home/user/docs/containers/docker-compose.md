# Docker Compose
Compose is the preferred way to define multi-service dev environments. It works with both rootless and rootful Docker (selected via Docker context).

## Rootless vs rootful usage
Use the same compose file; switch the daemon via context:
- Rootless: `docker context use rootless`
- Rootful: `docker context use rootful`

Context names are host-specific.

## Podman Compose
Podman can run the same compose files:
- Podman 4+: `podman compose -f compose.yml up --build`
- Older setups: `podman-compose -f compose.yml up --build`

Use rootless Podman by default; use `sudo podman compose` only when needed.
When bind-mounting host paths under Podman, **always** use a `compose.podman.override.yml` with `userns_mode: keep-id`.

## Dockerfile parity
- Set `build.dockerfile: Dockerfile` so Docker + Podman use the same build definition.
- Prefer `Dockerfile` over `Containerfile` unless the repo already uses `Containerfile`.
- Pass UID/GID build args when the Dockerfile expects them so ownership matches the runtime user.

## Network access templates
This pack provides compose templates that make network access explicit:
- **Default (online)**: normal bridge networking (internet access via the engine)
- **Offline override**: `network_mode: "none"` for the main service

Use the offline override for tests/lints that should not hit the internet.

## Rootless connectivity checklist
- Ensure you are using the correct context (`docker context ls`).
- Use the default network for online mode; avoid `network_mode: host` with rootless daemons.
- If DNS fails in rootless containers, add explicit DNS only when required and document why.

## UID/GID mapping for bind mounts
If you bind-mount host paths (source code, caches):
- Set the container `user:` to match the engine UID/GID (`id -u` / `id -g`).
- For Podman, require `userns_mode: keep-id` when supported.
- Use the UID/GID of the user running the rootless engine (see `rootless_env.sh` for helpers).

## Proxy support
If your environment requires proxies:
- Prefer a `.env` file for local-only values.
- Pass proxy env vars at runtime; avoid baking them into images.

## Security defaults
- Run the service as a non-root user in the container.
- Use `read_only: true` where feasible and mount only needed writable paths.
- Keep secrets out of compose files; use `.env` (ignored) or engine secrets when supported.

## Root override (when required)
If you must run as root inside the container:
- Add a `compose.rootful.override.yml` that sets `user: "0:0"` and relaxes hardening (`read_only: false`, clear `cap_drop`/`security_opt`).
- Keep it opt-in and document when it is required.

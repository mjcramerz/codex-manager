# Kubernetes workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-kubernetes.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: validate and apply Kubernetes manifests safely.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: namespace, RBAC, resources, secrets.
2) **Validate**: schema check, `kubeconform`/`kubectl apply --dry-run=server`.
3) **Apply**: `kubectl apply` with reviewed manifests.
4) **Verify**: rollout status, readiness, and logs.

## Safety rules
- Always set resource requests/limits.
- Avoid `latest` images.
- Keep secrets out of plain YAML.

## Security checkpoints
- Validate namespace and RBAC boundaries for every applied manifest set.
- Require pinned image references and hardened pod security settings.
- Block privileged or hostPath patterns unless explicitly approved.

## Testing checkpoints
- Run schema and policy checks plus `kubectl apply --dry-run=server`.
- Canary deploy and verify probes, rollout status, and service connectivity.
- Exercise rollback path using previous ReplicaSet or release revision.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Apply in dependency order (CRDs, controllers, then workloads).
- Use progressive rollout gates and pause on SLO or readiness regressions.
- Record applied resources, rollout evidence, and incident notes.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides kube-context, namespace scope, and rollout strategy.
- Executor hands off manifest list, rollout outputs, and observed anomalies.
- Receiver monitors stabilization window and owns follow-up manifest changes.

# CrowdSec workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-crowdsec.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: deploy CrowdSec with safe defaults and minimal false positives.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: log sources, threat model, remediation policy.
2) **Configure**: `acquis.yaml` and minimal collections.
3) **Validate**: parsing and scenario detection (no remediation).
4) **Apply**: enable bouncers and remediation.
5) **Verify**: ensure whitelists and overrides are correct.

## Safety rules
- Start in alert‑only mode and monitor noise.
- Keep API keys scoped to the minimal bouncer set.

## Security checkpoints
- Scope `acquis.yaml` inputs explicitly and avoid collecting unnecessary sensitive logs.
- Restrict bouncer/API credentials to minimal privileges and rotate keys on schedule.
- Review whitelists and ban scopes to avoid blocking trusted internal ranges.

## Testing checkpoints
- Run parser and scenario tests before enabling live remediation.
- Replay benign and malicious samples to measure false-positive behavior.
- Verify ban and unban paths work for each configured bouncer type.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Start in detection-only mode, then enable remediation in staged host groups.
- Maintain an emergency disable path for bouncers during incident response.
- Track decision retention, legal/compliance constraints, and owner sign-off.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides source log map, whitelist policy, and ban-duration targets.
- Executor shares active collections, parser/scenario results, and remediation state.
- Receiver monitors early alert volume and drives tuning for noisy scenarios.

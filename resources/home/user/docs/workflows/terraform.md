# Terraform workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-terraform.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: plan, review, and apply Terraform changes safely.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: modules, environments, backends, credentials.
2) **Init**: `terraform init` with backend config.
3) **Validate**: `fmt`, `validate`, `plan`.
4) **Review**: inspect plan output and policy checks.
5) **Apply**: run `apply` only after approval.
6) **Verify**: confirm state and outputs.

## Safety rules
- Never `apply` without a reviewed plan.
- Treat state as sensitive; avoid leaking it.
- Use locks to prevent concurrent applies.

## Security checkpoints
- Pin provider/module versions and verify source trust before planning.
- Protect remote state with encryption, locking, and least-privilege credentials.
- Review plan output for privilege expansion, public exposure, or destructive drift.

## Testing checkpoints
- Run `terraform fmt -check`, `terraform validate`, and environment-specific `plan`.
- Execute repository policy checks for IaC security if configured.
- Confirm drift-sensitive resources with refresh/import checks before apply.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Require approved plan artifacts tied to the exact commit/workspace before apply.
- Apply in smallest safe scope and avoid ad-hoc concurrent runs.
- Capture apply logs, resulting outputs, and lock/unlock events for auditability.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides workspace/backend context and approval gate owner.
- Executor shares plan summary, apply transcript, and any manual follow-up steps.
- Receiver schedules post-apply drift checks and next review window.

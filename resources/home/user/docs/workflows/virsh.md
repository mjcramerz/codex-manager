# virsh / KVM workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-virsh.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: manage libvirt domains safely with `virsh`.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: domain XML, storage, networks, permissions.
2) **Validate**: `virsh domxml-to-native` or `virt-xml-validate` when available.
3) **Apply**: define and start domains.
4) **Verify**: console access, network, disk attach.

## Safety rules
- Avoid destructive actions without confirmation.
- Keep XML definitions versioned.

## Security checkpoints
- Restrict libvirt access to approved operators/groups and audit privileged command usage.
- Review domain XML for passthrough or privilege-sensitive options before define/start.
- Validate network and storage isolation boundaries for each domain.

## Testing checkpoints
- Validate XML (`virsh define --validate` when available) before live updates.
- Boot and smoke-test console, network, and disk attach/detach behavior.
- Test snapshot/backup restore paths for changed domains.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Apply domain changes in maintenance windows aligned to downtime tolerance.
- Canary one representative VM before bulk XML or pool updates.
- Keep prior XML and rollback snapshot IDs ready for restore.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides domain list, storage/network constraints, and downtime budget.
- Executor hands off virsh command history, XML diffs, and validation output.
- Receiver monitors host and guest stability during the post-change window.

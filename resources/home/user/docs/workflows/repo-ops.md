# Repo operations workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-repo-ops.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: provide a repository operations playbook (git hygiene, releases, automation).


## Navigation
<!-- BEGIN:nav -->
- Parent: `$CODEX_HOME/docs/workflows/overview.md`
- Pack index: `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- Routing guide: `$CODEX_HOME/index/OVERVIEW.md`
<!-- END:nav -->


## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Skill routing
- Use skill `repo-ops`.
- Pair with `shell-bash`, `shell-zsh`, or `shell-sh` only when the repo implementation is explicitly shell-bound.

## Branching & commits
- Prefer small, topical commits with meaningful messages.
- Keep commits buildable when possible.
- Avoid mixing refactors with behavior changes.
- For risky operations (force push, tag delete), require explicit confirmation flags and `--dry-run` support.

## Branching model (mcr/*)
- Default branch: `mcr/main`.
- Feature work: `mcr/feature/<name>` → merge into `mcr/main`, then merge `mcr/main` into `mcr/staging` for tests/builds.
- Release branch: `mcr/release` holds the final shipped state; keep it in sync from `mcr/staging`.
- In fork mode (`github/*` mirrors present), keep `github/*` read-only and sync `origin/github/mcr/main -> github/mcr/main -> mcr/main` before patch checks.

## Pull request discipline
- PR description should include:
  - What changed and why
  - How to test (exact commands)
  - Risk assessment (security/perf/reliability)
- Keep diffs reviewable; split PRs if necessary.
- Prefer CI-required checks over “tribal knowledge”.

## Contributor policy alignment (Codex source)
- Keep issue-first intake and contributor expectations aligned with the active source repository's `docs/contributing.md` when present.
- Ensure CLA assumptions are reflected through the active source repository's `docs/CLA.md` when present, and do not assume PR template or CLA-automation files exist unless they are actually shipped.
- When creating pack guidance for source contributions, include explicit policy links and expected evidence.

## Releases
- Maintain a changelog with user-impactful entries.
- Prefer reproducible build pipelines (pinned toolchains, lockfiles).
- Sign artifacts and/or commits if your org requires it.
- Build once, deploy many: produce an artifact in CI and reuse it for deploy steps.
- For release builds, create and push a protected release tag at the tip of `mcr/release`; CI should refuse to build if the tag is not on the release tip.
- In fork mode, run release patch checks on `mcr/main` first, then synchronize `mcr/staging` from `mcr/main` and `mcr/release` from `mcr/staging` before pushing.
- For GitLab delivery overlays, keep release patch sets in `patches/release/` with deterministic ordering in `patches/release/series`.
- Keep delivery patch controls explicit in CI (`APPLY_PATCHES`, `APPLY_PATCHES_EXCLUDE`, `PATCH_RELEASE_DIR`, `PATCH_SERIES_FILE`) and preserve sync mutation order: checkout -> true sync -> version bump -> patch apply -> push.

## Automation principles
- Automate checks in CI: format, lint, tests, audits.
- Gate merges on required checks.
- Prefer deterministic scripts (no network unless necessary, pinned deps).
- Automation scripts must be safe-by-default: refuse ambiguous state, validate inputs, and avoid destructive defaults.

## Pack implementation notes
- Keep runtime module layout explicit: the active repository runtime modules, plus the installed runtime roots under `$CODEX_HOME/`, `$CODEX_AGENTS/`, and `$CODEX_SKILLS/`.
- Do not reintroduce previous flat loader fallback scripts under `lib/`.
- The legacy `codex-db-fetch` / `$CODEX_ROOT/mem/*` memory-runtime flow has been removed; keep related guidance retired.
- Path-constrain helper operations to repo/runtime roots; reject traversal or ambiguous paths.

## Suggested tools (optional)
- GitHub Actions: CI, CodeQL, dependency review
- Dependabot/Renovate: controlled dependency updates
- SBOM generation: Syft
- Vulnerability scan: Trivy, osv-scanner

## Security checkpoints
- Protect automation tokens with least privilege; audit scopes for git, GitHub, and CI bots.
- Require dry-run and confirmation gates for scripts that rewrite history, tags, or remotes.
- Log approver identity and rollback path before executing risky repo operations.

## Testing checkpoints
- Validate new repo scripts with shell checks and at least one safe dry-run example.
- Rehearse branch-sync/tag workflows on a non-critical branch before touching `mcr/*`.
- Ensure CI-required checks still cover files changed by automation-generated commits.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Record source/target SHAs for branch promotions and require `--ff-only` where policy expects it.
- For releases, confirm the release tag sits on the `mcr/release` tip before publish automation.
- Keep rollback strategy (revert/cherry-pick) documented for each repo operation.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Automation author hands command transcript, affected refs, and expected final git state.
- Reviewer confirms policy compliance (branch rules, signatures, CI gates) before merge/push.
- Next operator acknowledges pending risky steps and explicit go/no-go before continuing.

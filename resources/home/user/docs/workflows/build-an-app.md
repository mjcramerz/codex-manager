# Workflow: build an app (end-to-end)

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-build-an-app.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: a reliable, repeatable path from idea to a secure, testable MVP.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## 1) Define scope
- MVP vs production target
- Required endpoints/features and non-goals
- Data persistence and auth strategy
- Deployment target (local, container, cloud)

## 2) Select a template
- Python API: `$CODEX_HOME/templates/python/fastapi-app`
- Rust API: `$CODEX_HOME/templates/rust/axum-api`
- Web app: `$CODEX_HOME/templates/web/react-vite-app`
- CLI apps: `$CODEX_HOME/templates/python/cli-app`, `$CODEX_HOME/templates/rust/cli-app`
- Containers/VMs: `$CODEX_HOME/templates/containers/`, `$CODEX_HOME/templates/virtualization/`


## 3) Wire baseline (before features)
- Config validation at startup
- Structured logging + request IDs (APIs)
- Error handling without leaking internals
- Health endpoint and basic tests
- Security headers and request limits (APIs)

## 4) Implement a vertical slice
- One feature end-to-end with tests.
- Keep diffs small and reviewable.

## 5) Hardening pass
- Input validation + explicit size limits.
- Timeouts and bounded retries on all I/O.
- Add rate limiting/quotas if public-facing.
- Dependency audits and lockfiles.

## 6) CI/CD
- Add workflows from `$CODEX_HOME/templates/ci/github-actions/` or `$CODEX_HOME/templates/ci/gitlab-ci/`.
- Lint, test, and audit gates with minimal permissions.

## Branching & release flow
- Implement on `mcr/feature/<name>` and merge into `mcr/main` only after checks pass.
- Promote tested changes in order: `mcr/main -> mcr/staging -> mcr/release`.
- In fork mode (`github/*` mirrors present), treat `github/*` as read-only and never implement directly on mirror branches.
- In fork mode, sync `origin/github/mcr/main -> github/mcr/main -> mcr/main` before release patch checks.
- In fork mode, run release patch checks on `mcr/main` only, then create test branches from synced `mcr/main`.
- For GitLab-delivered GitHub releases, tag from the tip of `mcr/release` using your protected release tag contract.
- Keep delivery mutation order deterministic for release syncs: `checkout -> true sync -> version bump -> patch apply -> push` (with patches sourced from `patches/release/series`).

## Deterministic build checklist
- Pin toolchains and base images; avoid `:latest`.
- Commit lockfiles and use deterministic installs (`cargo --locked`, `npm ci`, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`).
- Keep version changes script-driven through the target repository's release helper scripts (for example `scripts/release/get_version.py` and `scripts/release/bump_version.py`).

## 7) Docs + runbook
- Update README with setup/run/test commands.
- Document config and operational notes.

## Security checkpoints
- Lock auth model, trust boundaries, and secret storage approach before shipping the first endpoint.
- Enforce request/body/file-size limits and timeout defaults in the initial scaffold.
- Audit new dependencies before merge and document any temporary vulnerability waiver.

## Testing checkpoints
- Require one happy-path and one abuse-path test for each externally reachable feature slice.
- Keep startup, health, and config-validation checks in the always-on smoke suite.
- Gate merges on template-aligned lint/unit/integration commands captured in README or CI.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Define the environment contract (required vars, secrets source, migrations) before first deploy.
- Promote local -> staging -> production with health checks and explicit rollback criteria.
- Publish a runbook with release command, rollback command, and on-call owner.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Feature owner hands API/schema contract and config deltas to test and deploy owners.
- Test owner hands failing repro, added tests, and expected outputs back to implementer.
- Release owner confirms artifact version/digest and rollout status before final sign-off.

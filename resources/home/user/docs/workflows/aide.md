# AIDE workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-aide.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: establish and monitor a file‑integrity baseline.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: critical paths and exclusions.
2) **Init**: generate a baseline database.
3) **Secure**: lock down DB and config permissions.
4) **Schedule**: run periodic checks.
5) **Review**: triage diffs and update baseline after approved changes.

## Safety rules
- Keep the baseline offline or read‑only when possible.
- Avoid monitoring volatile directories.

## Security checkpoints
- Require `aide.conf` and the baseline DB to stay root-owned and mode `0600`.
- Review include/exclude paths so volatile directories do not hide integrity drift.
- Treat baseline refresh as a privileged change with approval and traceable owner.

## Testing checkpoints
- Run `aide --check` on a clean host and capture the expected zero-drift output.
- Create a controlled file change in a monitored path to prove detection and alert flow.
- Verify scheduled runs write to the expected log target and rotation policy.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Roll out new rules in report-only mode before updating enforced baselines.
- Keep the previous baseline snapshot for rollback after noisy or unexpected deltas.
- Document who triages alerts, who approves baseline updates, and review cadence.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator provides monitored paths, approved exclusions, and baseline storage location.
- Executor hands off check output, noise findings, and any refreshed baseline artifacts.
- Receiver confirms timer/cron ownership and closes follow-up integrity exceptions.

# Kernel build workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-kernel-build.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: build and deploy a custom kernel safely.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: target hardware, modules, and policy requirements.
2) **Prepare**: pin toolchain, obtain source, verify signatures.
3) **Configure**: start from distro config and apply fragments.
4) **Build**: compile and package with reproducible flags.
5) **Install**: keep previous kernel available for rollback.
6) **Verify**: boot, validate modules, run smoke tests.

## Safety rules
- Never remove the last known‑good kernel.
- Test in a VM before deploying to bare metal.

## Security checkpoints
- Verify source tarballs/tags and patch provenance before build starts.
- Protect module or kernel signing keys and document signing policy.
- Review config fragments for unintended debug or insecure options.

## Testing checkpoints
- Build in a clean environment and archive config/toolchain metadata.
- Boot-test on VM or canary hardware and validate required module loading.
- Run smoke and regression benchmarks against the previous known-good kernel.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Install new kernel alongside existing fallback entries; never remove last-known-good.
- Promote through a canary ring before wider rollout.
- Document rollback steps (`grub-reboot`, package downgrade, rescue path) with owner.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator sets hardware matrix, mandatory modules, and policy constraints.
- Executor shares config diff, artifact locations, and boot-test logs.
- Receiver owns staged rollout tracking and regression triage.

# Web frontend workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-web-frontend.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: build and maintain frontend apps with safe defaults.


## Navigation
<!-- BEGIN:nav -->

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Pick framework**: React/Next/SvelteKit/Vue/Nuxt/HTMX.
2) **Scaffold**: start from templates; pin toolchains.
3) **Baseline**: lint, format, typecheck, tests.
4) **Build**: ensure reproducible builds and minimal bundles.
5) **Ship**: document run/build steps and environment config.

## Framework execution matrix
- **React (Vite)**: `pnpm lint` -> `pnpm test` -> `pnpm build`; enforce strict TypeScript and route-level code-splitting.
- **Next.js**: `pnpm lint` -> `pnpm test` -> `pnpm build`; verify server/client boundaries and no secret exposure in client bundles.
- **HTMX**: validate endpoint/partial contracts, CSRF behavior, and progressive-enhancement fallbacks; prefer server-rendered state transitions.
- **All web stacks**: include accessibility checks (keyboard navigation, landmarks, contrast) and bundle budget review.

## Codex source alignment
- Source repository currently has TypeScript tooling packages (`shell-tool-mcp/`, `sdk/typescript/`, `codex-cli/`) but no production React/Next.js/HTMX app tree.
- Keep frontend guidance synchronized with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and package-level scripts in source.

## Safety rules
- Avoid unpinned dependencies.
- Keep secrets out of client bundles.

## Security checkpoints
- Verify auth boundaries, CSRF/CSP posture, and no secret leakage to client bundles.
- Review dependency updates for provenance and lockfile integrity before merge.
- Audit unsafe HTML/render paths and route-level authorization checks.

## Testing checkpoints
- Run lint, typecheck, and unit tests plus framework-specific integration/e2e smoke.
- Include accessibility and bundle-budget checks in acceptance gates.
- Validate SSR/CSR behavior and error boundaries in production-like config.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Produce immutable build artifacts tagged to commit SHA and environment config.
- Promote through preview/staging with canary or feature-flag gates.
- Define rollback trigger and run post-deploy synthetic checks for critical routes.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator specifies framework, target environments, and release gate criteria.
- Executor hands off artifact IDs, test evidence, and runtime config diffs.
- Receiver owns deploy approval, monitoring dashboard checks, and incident response handoff.

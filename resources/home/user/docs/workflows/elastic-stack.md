# Elastic Stack workflow

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-elastic-stack.md` before executing this workflow.
Purpose: wire Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana safely.

## Plan
- Start from the linked workflow plan template above, then tailor scope, constraints, and validation commands before editing.
- Keep the plan updated as execution progresses, including risk and rollback notes for any sensitive change.

## Workflow
1) **Scope**: data sources, retention, access controls.
2) **Ingest**: design Logstash pipelines and validate samples.
3) **Store**: define index templates and ILM policies.
4) **Visualize**: create Kibana spaces and dashboards.
5) **Secure**: enable auth/TLS and restrict network exposure.

## Safety rules
- Treat logs as sensitive data.
- Avoid public endpoints without authentication.

## Security checkpoints
- Enable TLS and auth for Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and all ingest clients.
- Apply role/space isolation and least-privilege service credentials.
- Review pipelines for sensitive-field redaction before indexing.

## Testing checkpoints
- Validate Logstash pipelines with representative samples and mapping conflict checks.
- Test ILM rollover/retention behavior in non-production indices first.
- Verify dashboards and saved searches under restricted user roles.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Apply changes in dependency order and confirm version compatibility at each step.
- Snapshot critical indices or cluster state before template/ILM migrations.
- Track ingest lag, shard health, and auth errors during post-deploy observation.

## Multi-agent handoff
- Coordinator defines data-source priorities, retention policy, and access boundaries.
- Executor hands off pipeline test evidence, template/ILM diffs, and dashboard IDs.
- Receiver owns production monitoring thresholds and follow-up tuning backlog.

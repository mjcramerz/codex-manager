# Planning workflow
Purpose: provide the canonical planning workflow for this pack.

Start with `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/workflow-planning.md` before executing this workflow.

## Navigation
<!-- BEGIN:nav -->
- Parent: `$CODEX_HOME/docs/workflows/overview.md`
- Pack index: `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- Routing guide: `$CODEX_HOME/index/OVERVIEW.md`
<!-- END:nav -->

## Required routing contract
- `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/memories/MEMORY.md` when the task is repo-aware or ambiguous
- `$CODEX_HOME/INDEX.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/index/pack/plans.md` + `$CODEX_HOME/index/pack/workflows.md`
- `$CODEX_HOME/index/pack/skills.md`
- follow `$CODEX_HOME/docs/style/shell-runtime.md` before running commands

## Runtime-state boundary
- Use `$CODEX_HOME/memories/MEMORY.md` for context only when prior decisions matter.
- Treat the memory router and mirrored memory instruction assets as source-managed pack content when planning memory-related work.
- Keep plans grounded in stable installed pack surfaces and avoid repository-source paths in final guidance.

## Plan selection (quick guide)
- **Workflow-specific work**: use `$CODEX_HOME/plans/workflows/` (for example `workflow-<name>.md`).
- **Skill-driven work**: use `$CODEX_HOME/plans/skills/` (for example `skill-<name>.md`).
- **General engineering tasks**: use `$CODEX_HOME/plans/frameworks/` (feature, bugfix, refactor, security, perf, infra, docs).

## Plan schema (required sections)
A plan should include:
- **Objective**
- **Scope**
- **Constraints / Non-goals**
- **Current state (inventory)**
- **Plan (steps)**
- **Validation (tests & checks)**
- **Risks / Rollback**
- **References**

## Creation rules
- Non-trivial tasks and any multi-file refactor require a plan.
- If no template fits, create a new template in the correct plan family and list it in the relevant overview in the same change.
- When a plan touches external repos or delivery contracts, list those repos explicitly in the inventory section.

## Security checkpoints
- Add threat assumptions and privileged operations to the plan before implementation begins.
- Attach input bounds/timeouts to steps that touch I/O, parsing, or remote systems.
- Record waiver owner and expiry for every planned security exception.

## Testing checkpoints
- Every step includes a concrete verify command plus pass/fail expectation.
- For bugfix or hardening work, require at least one failing or abuse test in the plan.
- Define fast-path versus full-suite checkpoints for incremental validation.

## Deployment checkpoints
- Include rollout, rollback, and migration/flag steps when runtime behavior changes.
- Mark go/no-go gates and required evidence before staging/release promotion.
- Identify who confirms post-deploy health and where evidence is stored.

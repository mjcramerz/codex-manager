# Snippet catalog
Purpose: provide copy-ready hardened patterns for code, config, and operational workflows.

## Use this file when
- the target repo lacks an established implementation pattern
- you need a safe starting point for a script, service, config, or workflow helper
- you are maintaining snippet structure or deciding where a new snippet belongs

## How to use snippets
- Prefer snippets when they reduce boilerplate without fighting the target repo’s conventions.
- Adapt the snippet to the active repo instead of copying it blindly.
- Use the corresponding docs, workflow, or template guide when the snippet sits inside a larger operational flow.

## Major snippet families
- Bash and POSIX sh — shell baselines, repo helpers, and guarded automation
- Python, Go, TypeScript, Rust — language baselines and runtime-safe helpers
- systemd, CI, containers, infra, and observability — operational skeletons
- docs/process and prompts — reusable writing and contract fragments
- desktop, virtualization, and system hardening — host-focused configuration snippets

## Selection rules
- Shell-sensitive snippets require `$CODEX_HOME/UNIX.md` and the matching shell runtime.
- Use snippets for patterns; use templates for larger skeletons; use skills or workflows for execution guidance.
- If a snippet becomes a multi-file scaffold, promote it to a template instead of extending the snippet indefinitely.

## Maintenance rules
- Keep snippet names descriptive and stable.
- Keep snippets minimal but safe-by-default.
- Document important assumptions inline in the snippet or its nearest doc.
- Validate syntax or parseability for the formats you edit.

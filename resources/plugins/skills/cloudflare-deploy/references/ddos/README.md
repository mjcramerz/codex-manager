# Cloudflare DDoS Protection

Autonomous, always-on protection against DDoS attacks across L3/4 and L7.

## Protection Types

- **HTTP DDoS (L7)**: Protects HTTP/HTTPS traffic, phase `ddos_l7`, zone/account level
- **Network DDoS (L3/4)**: UDP/SYN/DNS floods, phase `ddos_l4`, account level only
- **Adaptive DDoS**: Learns 7-day baseline, detects deviations, 4 profile types (Origins, User-Agents, Locations, Protocols)

## Plan Availability

| Feature | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise | Enterprise Advanced |
|---------|------|-----|----------|------------|---------------------|
| HTTP DDoS (L7) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Network DDoS (L3/4) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Override rules | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 10 |
| Custom expressions | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Log action | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Adaptive DDoS | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Alert filters | Basic | Basic | Basic | Advanced | Advanced |

## Actions & Sensitivity

- **Actions**: `block`, `managed_challenge`, `challenge`, `log` (Enterprise Advanced only)
- **Sensitivity**: `default` (high), `medium`, `low`, `eoff` (essentially off)
- **Override**: By category/tag or individual rule ID
- **Scope**: Zone-level overrides take precedence over account-level

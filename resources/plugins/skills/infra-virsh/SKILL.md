  default-prompt: Act as the "INFRA-libvirt/virsh" specialist for "Manage libvirt/KVM workflows
    with virsh safely". Deliver focused, deterministic results with minimal, reviewable changes
    and explicit assumptions. Validate untrusted inputs and bounded I/O, run the narrowest
    relevant checks, and report concrete actions, evidence, and residual risks.

## Use this skill when
- defining or operating libvirt domains
- automating VM lifecycle steps

## Workflow
1) Author domain XML.
2) Define and start domains.
3) Verify console and networking.

## Checkpoint gates
- Host gate: verify KVM/libvirt capabilities, storage pool availability, and network definitions before domain changes.
- XML gate: validate domain XML schema and pin critical choices (machine type, CPU mode, disk bus, NIC model); validate storage and network XML before define/start.
- Provision gate: define and start domains in reversible steps (`define` -> `start` -> `autostart`) with explicit teardown path.
- Data safety gate: separate `destroy` from `undefine` decisions and call out when disks/snapshots may be deleted.

## Agent orchestration
- Confirm that the request fits this skill and state boundaries if other skills are needed.
- For multi-step work, keep a concise plan, execute in small reversible steps, and surface assumptions early.
- Delegate only independent discovery tasks, then reconcile findings before making edits.

## Validation and testing
- Schema validation: run `virsh domxml-validate <domain.xml>` before `virsh define`.
- Runtime validation: confirm domain state and resources (`virsh domstate`, `virsh dominfo`, `virsh domblklist`).
- Connectivity validation: verify console/login and network assignment (`virsh console` or `virsh domifaddr`) after boot.
- Lifecycle validation: test stop/start/reboot behavior and confirm autostart, snapshot, and backup expectations.

## Outputs
- Validated domain XML plus required pool/network definitions and assumptions.
- Lifecycle command runbook (define/start/stop/reboot/destroy/undefine) with safety warnings.
- Post-provision verification checklist and rollback path for failed boots or misconfigured networking.

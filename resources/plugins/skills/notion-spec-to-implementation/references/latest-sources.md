# notion-spec-to-implementation reference bundle

- Last refreshed: 2026-02-11 (UTC)
- Freshness method: web.run lookups against primary vendor/project documentation roots.

## Skill purpose
Turn Notion specs into implementation plans, tasks, and progress tracking; use when implementing PRDs/feature specs and creating Notion plans + tasks from them.

## SKILL.md coverage checklist
- Use this skill when
- Quick start
- Workflow
- 0) If any MCP call fails because Notion MCP is not connected, pause and set it up:
- 1) Locate and read the spec
- 2) Choose plan depth
- 3) Create tasks
- 4) Link artifacts
- 5) Track progress
- Agent orchestration
- Validation and testing
- Outputs
- References and examples

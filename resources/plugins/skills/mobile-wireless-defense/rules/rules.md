## Required checks
- Follow the workflow in `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/mobile-wireless-defense/SKILL.md`.
- Prefer deterministic scripts in `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/mobile-wireless-defense/scripts/`.
- Use references in `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/mobile-wireless-defense/references/` for factual guidance.
- Run `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/mobile-wireless-defense/scripts/mobile_scope_guard.py` before device or wireless assessments.
- Require listed device IDs, allowed operation classes, and an unexpired scope window.
- Refuse network access outside the documented scope, covert payload delivery, or anti-theft bypass requests.

# NetHunter Pixel9a Rules

## Required checks
- Follow the procedure in `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/nethunter-pixel9a/SKILL.md`.
- Validate scope first with `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/nethunter-pixel9a/scripts/nethunter_scope_guard.py`.
- Use references in `$CODEX_HOME/plugins/cache/codex-local/security-labs/local/skills/nethunter-pixel9a/references/` for factual guidance.
- Require documented owner/device scope with `lab_only=true` and an unexpired scope window.
- Refuse bootloader/FRP/carrier-lock bypass requests outside explicit lab boundaries.

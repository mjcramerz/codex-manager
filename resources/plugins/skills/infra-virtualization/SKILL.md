## Use this skill when
- creating or improving VM-based dev/test environments
- documenting or configuring libvirt/QEMU/KVM
- adding Vagrant-based workflows
- choosing VM networking modes (NAT/bridged/isolated)

## Non-negotiables
- Treat host changes as high-impact; require explicit confirmation.
- Make network access explicit and document the chosen mode.
- Prefer reproducible images/boxes; avoid `latest`; pin box/image version and checksum when available.
- Provide cleanup/rollback steps.

## Workflow
1) Clarify OS target, virtualization stack, and network needs.
2) Choose the scaffold:
   - `$CODEX_HOME/templates/virtualization/vagrant-libvirt-skeleton/`
   - or `$CODEX_HOME/docs/virtualization/qemu-kvm-libvirt.md`
3) Define networking mode (NAT/bridged/isolated) and document it.
4) Pin base images/boxes and record checksums when possible.
5) Provide run and teardown commands.

## Checkpoint gates
- Host readiness gate: verify virtualization support, kernel modules, disk capacity, and required libvirt networks before provisioning.
- Image integrity gate: pin VM images/boxes and record checksum or source digest for reproducibility and rollback.
- Network gate: document NAT/bridged/isolated mode, firewall impact, and expected inbound exposure before boot.
- Deployment gate: define ordered bring-up and teardown steps (`up`, smoke checks, snapshot, destroy) with data-retention policy.

## Agent orchestration
- Confirm that the request fits this skill and state boundaries if other skills are needed.
- For multi-step work, keep a concise plan, execute in small reversible steps, and surface assumptions early.
- Delegate only independent discovery tasks, then reconcile findings before making edits.

## Validation and testing
- Host validation: run stack-specific checks (`virt-host-validate`, `virsh net-list --all`, provider status checks) before creating guests.
- Config validation: validate Vagrant/libvirt definitions (`vagrant validate` when available, schema/lint checks for domain XML).
- Guest validation: confirm boot, SSH/console access, provisioning success, and required service health inside the VM.
- Network validation: verify guest-to-host and guest-to-external connectivity for the chosen mode, including blocked-path expectations for isolated labs.
- Rollback validation: test snapshot restore or reprovision path before promoting the workflow for shared use.

## Outputs
- Reproducible VM definition bundle (Vagrant/libvirt config, pinned image sources, and network mode rationale).
- Deployment runbook with create, validate, snapshot, teardown, and cleanup commands.
- Verification matrix for host readiness, guest health, networking behavior, and rollback readiness.
